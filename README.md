# ATM Simulation System

A Python-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation that mimics the core functionalities of a real ATM. This project is designed to demonstrate basic banking operations, user authentication, and secure transaction handling in a console-based environment.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login system with PIN verification.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check account balance in real time.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw specific amounts with balance validation.
- **Deposit Funds**: Add funds to the account and update the balance.
- **Transaction History**: View a record of past transactions (if implemented).
- **Exit Option**: Securely end the session.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for developing the project.
- **File Handling**: For saving and retrieving user data (if applicable).
- **OOP Concepts**: Used for structuring the codebase efficiently.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
